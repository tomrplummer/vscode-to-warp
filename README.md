   ```

2. Navigate the theme list using arrow keys
3. Type to filter themes by name
4. Press Enter to convert the selected theme
5. The converted theme will be saved to `~/.warp/themes/`
6. Select the new theme in Warp's settings

## How it Works

The tool:

1. **Discovers themes** by scanning `~/.vscode/extensions/*/themes/*.json`
2. **Parses VS Code theme JSON** to extract color information
3. **Maps colors** from VS Code format to Warp's YAML format:
   - Editor background/foreground ‚Üí Terminal background/foreground
   - Terminal colors ‚Üí ANSI color palette
   - Focus/accent colors ‚Üí Accent color
4. **Generates YAML** in Warp's theme format
5. **Saves** to `~/.warp/themes/` with a clean filename

## Color Mapping

| VS Code | Warp |
|---------|------|
| `editor.background` | `background` |
| `editor.foreground` | `foreground` |
| `focusBorder`, `button.background`, etc. | `accent` |
| `terminal.ansi*` | `terminal_colors.normal.*` |
| `terminal.ansiBright*` | `terminal_colors.bright.*` |

## Requirements

- VS Code installed with theme extensions
- Warp terminal
- Go 1.21+ (for building from source)

## Examples

The tool converts themes like:
- Catppuccin variants
- Material themes
- One Dark Pro
- Dracula
- Gruvbox
- And any other VS Code theme with proper color definitions

## Troubleshooting

**No themes found**: Ensure VS Code is installed and you have theme extensions installed.

**Permission errors**: The tool creates `~/.warp/themes/` if it doesn't exist.

**Colors look off**: Some VS Code themes may not define all terminal colors, so defaults are used.
